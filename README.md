## *The only way to learn R is by doing some exercises every day!*

Two sessions: date and location TBD

### Description, difficulty level and Learning goals:
Short explanation of basic R topics tailored to the needs of a bachelor project.

Difficulty level: third year bachelor 

Learning goals:
-	Basic understanding of R/Rstudio
-	Basic understanding of programming/ control flows
-	Data generation/ simulation
-	User defined functions

At the end of this brief R course, you will have a basic understanding of the R language and you will be able to use R during your bachelor project. Moreover, this crash course will give you some confidence to further develop your R programming skills for future courses (e.g. during your Master’s degree) and/or professional career.

### Materials
-	Introduction to R and Computational Statistics (2017-2018). By Frank Busing and Bunga Pratiwi. (From the Methodology and Statistics Master R course).
-	Simulation Study Tutorial using R on your Laptop/PC (2018). By Elise Dusseldorp, Jeffrey Durieux, Juan C. Gonzalez and Bunga C. Pratiwi. [click here for the pdf](https://github.com/Github-MS/Shark/blob/master/Simulation_study_PC_laptop/Simulationstudy_laptopV1.2.pdf)

### Topics covered:
*	Introduction to R and Rstudio (console, workspace, script, commenting)
*	How to get help (short and sufficient answer: www.google.com)
*	Installing and loading R – packages
*	Simple data generation and simple (built-in) functions
*	Simple arithmetic on scalars, vectors, and matrices
*	Indexing
*	Perform simple data analysis 

*	Programming skills: 
    *	User defined functions
    *	For loop
    *	Conditionals (if, if else)
  
  
*	Miscellaneous: useful stuff for a simulation study:
    * set.seed()
    * expand.grid()
    * working directories
    * saving data and output
